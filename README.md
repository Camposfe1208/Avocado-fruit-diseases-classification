On this repo, you'll find the project that I did for my bachelor's degree.
It consists of high quality images of the most common post-harvest diseases on avocado's fruit (scab and anthracnosis) and healthy fruits.

The dataset consists of 569 original images for training and validation; due to a small dataset, I used data augmentation techniques such as rotate and invert "x" and "y" axes giving an amount of 3,983 images.

The code is shown in the Python file /Avocado's Fruit Diseases Classification.py/
