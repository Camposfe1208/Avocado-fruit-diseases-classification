On this repo, you'll find the project that I did for my bachelor's degree.
It consists of high quality images of the most common post-harvest diseases on avocado's fruit (scab and anthracnosis) and healthy fruits.

I followed the work of Pulkit Sharma (2019) with the entry ["Build your First Multi-Label Image Classification Model in Python"](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/build-your-first-multi-label-image-classification-model-in-python-8fc127e3ca7a), and the code that I used, was based from these work.

The dataset consists of 569 original images for training and validation; due to a small dataset, I used data augmentation techniques such as rotate and invert "x" and "y" axes giving an amount of 3,983 images.
