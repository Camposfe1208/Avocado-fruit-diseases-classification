# Avocado-fruit-diseases-classification

On this repo, you'll find the project that I did for my bachelor's degree.
It consists of high quality images of the most post-harvest diseases on avocado's fruit (scab and anthracnosis) and healthy fruits.

I followed the work of Pulkit Sharma (2019) with the entry "Build your First Multi-Label Image Classification Model in Python", and the code that I used, was given from these work.

The dataset consists of 569 original images for training and validation; due to a small dataset, I used data augmentation techniques such as rotate and invert "x" and "y" axes giving an amount of 3,979 images.
