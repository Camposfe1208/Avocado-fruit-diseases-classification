On this repo, you'll find the project that I did for my bachelor's degree.
It consists of high quality images of the most common post-harvest diseases on avocado's fruit ðŸ¥‘ (scab and anthracnosis) and healthy fruits.

The dataset consists of 569 original images for training and validation; due to a small dataset, I used data augmentation techniques such as rotate and invert "x" and "y" axes giving an amount of 3,983 images.

Otherwise, 100 independent images of the model were used to evaluate the disease classifier.

The code is shown in the Python file [Avocado's Fruit Diseases Classification.py](https://github.com/Camposfe1208/Avocado-fruit-diseases-classification/blob/master/Avocado's%20Fruit%20Diseases%20Classification.py)

The dataset is in [my personal Kaggle page.](https://www.kaggle.com/camposfe1/clasifiacin-de-enfermedades-del-aguacatero)
